                    I am a junior full stack web developer living in Paris. 
                    I started learning coding on my own at the beginning of 2020.
                    A year later, I was enrolled into a State-certified bootcamp called Konexio.

                    I'm able to design and build websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                    I use various front-end and back-end technologies such as React, NodeJs, Bootstrap, Jquery and MongoDB.
                    I intend to learn coding beyond web development, aiming to someday become a well-rounded programmer able to work in web, softwares, applications and video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I draw mangas or trade in the stock market. Sometimes I play video games.
